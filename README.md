# LRU (Least Recently Used) / Optimum Agorithm
## authors: Jesus Cueva, Johnnie Miralda, Gerardo Gonzales

This project was made for a class of Operating Systems in which we studied the algorithms used by different OS' to manage the paging memory. In this case we coded 
the LRU algorithm and the Optimum algorithm both in C++ and with the use of pthreads.
